# Chapter 6 Sensation and Perception

## 6.1 Sensory System Principles
<!--Page 194-->

> The world is full of physical events--sounds, odors, lights--that provide clues about what's going on around you. That is why natural selection has crafted remarkably cophisticated ways to detect nearby squeaks and far-off roars, hovering mosquitoes and distant mountains, fragrant fruits and repellent skunks. We rely heavily on our senses to make our way in the world. 

In psychology, **sensation** is *distinguished* from **perception**.

> **_Sensation_** is the process by which the nervous system detects the physical events going on around us and inside us.
>
> **_Perception_** is the **experience** we have as we *further process* and **interpret** information.
>
> > "We sense the presence of a stimulus, but we perceive what it is."



> In many cases the brain actually *distorts* sensoty information, giving us perceptions that do not really reflect what's going on because some bits of information are a lot more important than others.

### Sensation begins with a stimulus

**_Stumulus_** (plural **stimuli**): any physical event that may affect a **sensory receptor cell** (or simply **receptor**).


**_Modalities_**: different types of senses


__The Five Commonly Described Senses__

|Sensory system | Modality | Adequate stimuli|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Vision | Seeing | Light|
|Touch | Touch | Contact|
|Audition | Hearing | Sounds|
|**Olfaction** | Smell | Chemicals in the air or water|
|**Gustation** | Taste | Chemicals in the mouth|


__Other Important Human Senses__

|Sensory system | Modality | Adequate stimuli|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Vestibular** | Balance | Movement of the head|
|**Proprioception** | Body sense | Movement of the body|


__Senses We Do Not Have__

|Sensory system | Modality | Adequate stimuli|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Electrical | Electroreception | Changes in electrical currents (some fish)|
|Magnetic| Magnetoreception | Earth's magnetic field (some birds)|

All neurons send **action potentials** to the brain, but the brain *interprets* these action potentials very differently.

**_Lable lines_**: the concept that specific nerves are dedicated to relaying specific types of sensory information (sensory modality) to the brain

### All detection systems have thresholds

**_Sensory code_**: the relationship between stimuli and the action potentials they produce in sensory cells

A stimulus that is just barely strong enough to affect the receptor is a **_threshold stimulus_**.

### Psychophysics systematically analyzes perception

**_Psychophysics_** is the study of the relationship between *a physical stimulus* and our *psychological experience* of that stimulus.

**_Absolute threshold_**: the lowest intensity of a stimulus that can be detected **half the time**

**_Just noticeable difference_** (aka. **JND**, **difference threshold**): the smallest change in magnitude that a person can notice the difference.

Ernst Weber discovered a mathematical relationship between JNDs and a stimulus.

var **_Weber's fraction_** : Float = (the smallest change of a detectable stimulus) / (the original stimulus)

> Weber's fraction to detect a difference in *weight* is **2%**.

### Detection involves finding a signal in a background of noise

**_Signal detection theory_** is concerned with measuring how we detect a signal in the midst of noise. 

> Many factors affect how well we detect signals. For example, if we are frightened, we will notice more sound than when we feel safe. 

Our brains do not passively receive signals, but instead **actively screen** sensory input and determine whether each input is actually a signal or just noise. 

The brain sets a criterion for deciding whether the stimulus is noise or signal. The brain may shift the criterion depending on **which mistake is worse**: a **false alarm** or a **miss**. 

### A stimulus that doesn't change is unimportant, so sensory systems ignore it

**_Sensory adaptation_** is the progressive **loss of responsiveness** in sensory cells exposed to a **constant stimulus**.

Your eyes constantly making very small involuntary movements, called **saccades**. The constant movement means that your light receptors, whih adapt very quickly, are exposed to a constantly shifting scene to avoid adaption. That's why you continue to see.

## 6.2 Touch and Pain
<!--Page 203-->

### Our nerves provide information about a specific type of stimulation

|Touch receptors | Adequate stimuli|
|:---|:---|
|Meissner's corpuscle | touch|
|Pacinian corpuscle | vibration|
|Merkel's disc | light touch|
|Nerves wrapped around hair follicles | bend of the hair|
|Free nerve endings | damage \| temperature|

### Touch perception is more refined than you might think

**The paradoxical heat illusion**: two different copper pipes

The touch receptors are faithfully reporting the sensations "warm" and "cool", but the brain puts the two together to come up with the perception of "burning". This illusion relies on **putting together unusual sensations** to give us a false perception.

### Different receptor cells have different receptive fields

**_Receptive field_** of a sensory cell: the total **region of space** where stimuli will alter the cell's firing rate. 

> Receptive fields for other modalities describe a different "region of space". 

>> The receptive field for visual system is the part of the visual field where light affects the neuron's firing. 
>> 
>> The receptive field for auditory system is the loudness, frequency, and location. 

**Aristotle's touch illusion**: crossing fingers touch one object but feel like two

### Painlessness is hazardous to your health

**_Nociceptors_**: free nerve endings that are specialized **pain receptors** 

Detection of damage triggers action potentials that signal the brain to result in the perception of pain.

**_Congenital insensitiviy to pain (CIP)_**: Unbale to feel pain (*Congenital* means "present at birth")

People with CIP tend to live short, unhealthy lives.

> The version of a *recessive gene* that produces a *sodium (Na+) channel protein* associated with free nerve ending in the relatives with CIP has *a mutation that made it dysfunctional*. 
> 
> When the channel does not work properly, no nociceptor signals reach the brain and so no pain is perceived. 

>> If a nonaddictive painkiller could be developed that affects only that sodium channel protein, then we could stop pain without any other side effects.


### Pain illutrates the vast difference between sensation and perception

**_Phantom limb pain_**: the perception of pain in a missing appendage

**_Neuropathic pain_**: pain caused by a damaged or malfunctioning nervous system like the perception of pain starting either in the spinal cord or brain

One theory is that the phantom pain is caused by the brain **receiving disordered input** from the body, and that by giving the brain cues that cuggest the body is whole again, the input is reorganized and stops being painful. 
Pain perception is *not* a simple reporting of sensory fibers from the body. 

## 6.3 Vision
<!--Page 211-->

### Reflective light arrives on the retina

The bending of light by the **_cornea_** (the round, transparent front of the eyes) and **_lens_** (a flexible, transparent structure behind the cornea) works to focus a sharp image onto the retina. 

**_Fovea_**: the part of our retina where our vision is sharpest.

Because of the shape of the lens, the image focused on the retina is **upsite down and reversed**. 

**_Photoreceptors_**: light-detecting neurons

**_Rod Photoreceptors_** are extremely **sensitive**, so they can detect **very low level** of light, but they respond about the same to light of any wavelength. Crucial for night vision.

**_Cone photoreceptors_** are insensitive, but  selectively sensitive to light of different wavelengths, allowing us to distinguish colors.

The **_visual field_** is the part of space we can see without moving our eyes. 

### We all have our blind spots

The axons exit the eye in a round region called the **_optic disc_**. There are *no* rods or cones on the optic disc. 
The areas lacking information from the visual field are called **_blind spots_**.

The blink spot offers another example of the difference between sensation and perception. The brain *distorts sensory information*, filling in those gaps.

### Divide and conquer: How visual information reaches the two hemispheres of the brain

The *right side* of the brain receives visual information in the *left half* of the visual field.

Axons from the retinas synapse in the brainstem region called the **_thalamus_**.

Each thalamic neuron *then* sends their axons to **primary visual cortex** (aka. V1) in the **occipital lobe**. Almost every nueron in the visual cortex receives visual information from both eyes.

### Having two eyes helps bring us the world in 3D

**_Depth perception_** is the ability to perceive distance.

**_Binocular cues_**: information provided by the use of **two eyes**.

The difference from two eyes is called **_binocular disparity_**.

*Near* objects present a *greater* binocular disparity for each objects.

The **coming together** of the two eyes to focus on *really close* onjects is called **_convergence_**.

**_Monocular cues_**: **depth cues** that are available even to **one eye**

* **_Occlusion_**: Nearby objects block ("occlude") your view of more distant objects.

* **_Size cue_**: the farther the object is, the smaller it appears.

* **_Linear perspective depth cue_**: As the parallel lines move away, they appear to converge.

* **_Distance fog cue_**: The farther away the object is, the foggier it appears.

* **_Motion parallax_**: the shifting of a visual scene on the retina as the head moves

### Our eyes adjust to massive changes in light intensity

> Our eyes use two different processes to deal with the big differences in light.

1. The **_iris_** opens up to make the **_pupil_** larger, letting more light in, or closes down to make the pupil smaller, reducing how much light gets to the retina. 

2. **_Photoreceptor adaptation_** is the ability of rods and cones to change their sensitivity.

The changes in out visual sensitivity to light bring up yet another difference between sensation and perception. The visual system is constantly detecting how much light enters our eyes. 

### What is the physical nature of color?

We can think of photons in terms of the **frequency** of the wave they produce as they vibrate through space.

### Color is constructed by the brain

Both the **trichromatic** and the **color opponent theories** are at least partly correct.

* **_Trichromatic theory_**: the idea that color vision is based on receptors for three different colors
* **_Color opponent theory_** (aka. opponent-process theory): the idea that color vision is based on a system of paired opposites of color

Our information about color comes from **comparing** the activity of **different kinds of receptors**.

By reporting to the brain how much total light is present, the *rods* also inform us about color. If we keep dimming the lights, eventually we will fall below the threshold for cones and will experience no colors at all.

One color of light that **does not stimulate rods** much is **red**. That's why cars use red light for the dashboard at night.

> All cats look grey in the dark.

### The visual system uses shortcuts to provide nearly instantaneous protection

* One thing that our brain *automatically assumes* when looking at a scene is that **the light is falling from above**. 

* Another shortcut used by the visual system is to assume that **nonliving objects do not change much**. 

	* **_Shape consistancy_**: the visual perception that an object retains the same shape, no matter what angle we happen to see it from.
	* **_Size consistancy_**: the visual perception that an object does not change size, even as we get closer or farther away from it. This is a safe assumption in general. 
	* **_Color consistancy_**: the visual perception that an object retains the same color, no matter what color light is shining on it. (like the Ponzo illusion)

In real life, these percepts are almost always accurate. 

### The visual system organizes perceptions of groups of objects

In the early 20th century, a group of German psychologists founded **_Gestalt psychology_**, which emphasizes that the **whole perception** is **more than just the sum** of seperate sensations. 

**_Apparent motion_**: the tendency to see motion when looking at individual photos one after another. 

The **_Gestalt rules of perception_** explain ways in which vision organizes images.

* The **_rule of continuity_**: We tend to impart continuity, assuming the objects are permanent. It also explains why we perceive an uninterrupted visual field with the blind spots.
* The **_Gestalt rule of proximity_**: We tend to perceive objects that are close to one another as part of a whole. 
* The **_Gestalt rule of similarity_**: The more figures resemble each other in color, texture, shape, and so on, the more likely we are to regard them as part of some whole.
* The **_rule of closure_**: Our perception tends to fill in gaps, closing them off to perceive a whole object.
* The **_Gestalt rule of symmetry_** (aka. the **figure-ground rule**): We perceive symmetrical lines as being part of a single object. 

Gestalt psychologists were early and strong proponents of the distinction between sensation and perception that all psychologists recognize today. 

## 6.4 Hearing

<!--Page 231-->

<!--Helen Keller, who was both deaf and blind, noted that blindness deprives you of contact with things, while deafness deprives you of contact with people.--> 

### Sound is a pattern of pressure in the air (or water)

Air molecules in motion _bump against each other_, resulting in alternating waves of high and low density called _sound waves_.

### The outer and middle ears funnel sound to the cochlea

The **_outer ear_** (aka. **pinna**) serves as a funnel, gathering sounds from a wide area around us and directing those sounds down a tunnel leading to the middle ear.

The **_middle ear_** consists of the **eardrum** (or **tympanum**), which vibrates in response to sounds gathered from the outer ear, and three tiny little bones (**ossicles**, **incus**, and **stapes**) that transmit the vibration to the inner ear. 

> The amound of *amplification* from eardrum to inner ear *can be adjusted* by the tiny muscle attatched to the ossicles.

The **_inner ear_** consists of a tiny snail-shaped orgaan called the **_cochlea_** that detects sounds.

**_Oval window_**: the opening from the middle ear to the cochlea of the inner ear.

### The cochlea detecs the various frequencies of sound

The vibrations from the trapes push on the oval window, sending vibrations into the fluid inside the cochlea.

### The cochlea picks up vibrations

The hair cells inside the cochlea detect the vibrations along the membrane and send that information to the brain. 

### Sound localization

**_Binaural cues_**: information about the location of sound found by comparing input to the two ears.

1. **Intense difference**: comparision the intensities of the sounds (mid-freq to high-freq) that reach two ears

	The **sound shadow** cast by our head magnifies the intensity difference of sounds reaching the two ears. It doesn't help much to localize low-freq sounds.

2. **Latency difference**: the different times of a sound (low-freq to mid-freq) arrives at two ears.
	
	300 microsec in between
	
**_Duplex theory_**: We use both differences to locate sounds.

## 6.5 Taste and Smell
<!--Page 237-->

### Our nose and tongue are exquisitely sensitive chemical detectors

**_Flavor_**: the compined stimulation provided to taste receptors in the mouth and olfactory receptors in the nose. 

### Five taste receptors contribute to flavor

Taste buds: collections of 50-150 cells

* taste pore
* taste receptor cells

**_Tastant_**: a chemical that encounters the taste receptor cell and excites it

In sum, there is a taste receptor organ (the tongue), which has on its surface **taste receptor cells**, which produce **taste receptor proteins** that actually detect the **bitter**, **sour**, **sweet**, **salty**, or **umami** (meaty molecules, i.e. amino acids).

Some *bitter receptor* proteins are *not* expressed by taste receptor cells *until maturity*.

### Thousands of different odor receptors bring us the richness of flavor

**_Olfactory receptor neurons_** detect odors and are embedded in a sheet of cells, called the **_olfactory epithelium_**, lining the inside of the nose. 

Molecues that can be smelled are called **_odorants_**.

**_Olfactory bulb_**: the part of the brain that receives impulses from the axons of the olfactory receptor neurons.

We can distinguish thousands of different odorants by detecting the relative activity of many different kinds of olfactory receptors.
