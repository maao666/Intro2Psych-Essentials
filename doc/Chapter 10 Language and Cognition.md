## 10.1 Language 
<!--Page 398-->

### What are the components of human language?

**_Phonemes_**: the basic speech sounds that make up languages

**_Morphemes_**: the basic units of meaning in a language. They are **composed of phonemes**.
For example, the word unfathomable consists of the *morphemes* *un* ("not"), *fathom* ("understand"), and *able* ("capable of"). 

Grammar

* **_Semantics_**: the study of the meaning of words

* **_Syntax_**: the rules for constructing phrases and sentences in a language

Because language has the vast capacity to product so many different sentences, it is said to be **_generative_**.

Every sentence has two layers of representation.

* The **_surface structure_** is the particular string of the words that are put together in a sentence.
* The **_deep structure_** is the particular meaning (semantic relations) beneath the surface structure.

All human languages may share a common deep structure.

### Animals communication reveals the evolutionary roots of language

Plenty of non-human animals vocalize as well as gesture.

Many species are capable of vocal learning and use their vocalizations to help form social bonds and identify one another. 

Genetic studies support the idea that brain systems controlling language evolved from communication systems like those found in other animals. 

### Can other animals acquire languange with training?

Chimpanzees are capable of learning many of the hand gestures of American Sign Language (ASL). 

Another strategy for teaching language to animals is to choose a species that may not be closely related to us but is adapted for flexible, oral communication, namely a parrot.

The question of whether other animals can really learn language is not likely to be settled anytime soon.

### We start life ready to decode any language we happen to hear

A newborn will fuss, cry, and laugh, but by 6 months or so most babies **_babble_**, making meaningless sounds that are strung together such that they resemble speech.

**_Telegraphic speech_**: providing only a few words, or even a single word, to communicate.

The child's pronounciation of words is likely to be imperfect at first, which means that in the early stages, the child's family and caregivers may be the only ones who effectively get the message.

### Psychologists use behavior to test babies' language ability

The baby's developing languagge abilities are especially shaped by **_motherese_**, the singsong, high-pitched speech with slow, exaggerated pronunciation that parents use with their babies in all cultures. 

Individuals with **_Willians syndrome_** speak freely and fluently with a large vocabulary, yet they may be unable to draw simple images, arrange colored blocks.

The learning of language is distinct from other forms of intelligence, perhaps because humans evolved a specialized capacity to acquire language.

### There are sensitive periods for learning a language

**_Sensitive period_**: a time during development when exposure to a stimulus has the greatest effect on a particular behavior

**_Bilingualism_**: the ability to fluently use more than one language.
Infants exposed to more than one language may be a tiny bit slower at reaching some developmental milestones for language.

Early in life the brain is prepared to learn one or more languages and to build up an efficient brain network to support that ability.

### Some people have a harder time learning to read

**_Dyslexia_**: developmental reading disorder

Some cases of dyslexia result from abnormal migration of neurons during prenatal development.

The little nests of extra cells, called **_ecropias_**, in the cortex, suggesting that some migrating cells did not reach their approprate destination. 

### For most people, the left hemisphere of the brain controls language

**_Aphasia_**: an impairment of language after acquisition, often the result of a brain injury or disease

When **_Broca's area_**, a region atht e bottom of the *left frontal lobe*, is damaged, a person will have extreme difficulty speaking-a condition known as **_Broca's aphasia_** (aka. nonfluent aphasia).

**_Wernicke's aphasia_** (fluent aphasia): an impairment in understanding what is heared or read accompanied by fluent speech, which may be garbled

**_Wernicke's area_**: the area at the top of the temporal lobe that is damaged in fluent aphasia.

The critical role of the left hemisphere is confirmed by the **_Wada test_**, when a fast-acting anesthetic is injected into blood vessels feeding one hemisphere or the other in healthy volunteers. Anesthetizing the left hemisphere almost always disrupts speech. 

Aphasia patients are better at detecting liars. This sensitivity to lying may result from a lack of distraction by the words being spoken and being good at interpreting other people's emotions based on their facial expressions. 

**_Hemispherectomy_**: surgically remove the malfunctioning hemisphere

### What is the right cerebral hemisphere for?

**_Laterization_**: the tendency for the right and left cerebral hemispheres to differ in their specializations

The right hemisphere may be responsible for our understanding and appreciation of music, recognizing faces, expressing our own emotions and to detect the emotions of others.

### Language and culture can influence our thought processes

**_Linguistic relativism_**: The language we speak **influences** (rather than determines) the way we think.

Languages affects our **perception of _colors_**.

Differences in the ways languages label colors do not affect our ability to perceive colors or discriminate them, but may affect how **quickly** we can search, discriminate, or remember them. 

Culture doesn't seem to affect basic **perception of _number_** of objects, but affects **efficient encoding** of information about numbers.

People who speak languages relying on absolute compass direction are much better at keeping track of where they are. 

The strategy of **observing a person's behavior** in order to make inferences about how she is thinking is the **hallmark of cognitive Psychology**.

## 10.2 Deconstructing Mental Processes
<!--Page 419-->

**_Cognitive psychology_**: the study of internal mental processes

### There are two kinds of people, and both of them categorize

**_Concept_**: an abstract idea or mental representation of an object or event. 
The concept is the **mental representation** of the object or event, *not the word* for that object or event.

The human mind avoids having to have words for every variant of every object or concept by recognizing characteristics that are shared by certain objects or events-**_categorization_**. 

**_Prototype_**: the best example of a concept that fits a particular category.

### Mental processes take time

**_Reaction time_**: the time it takes for a person to start or complete a response

### We preproduce images and manipulate them in our mind

**_Mental imagery_**: the ability to visualize images or events in our mind

### There are at lease three stages in acquiring a skil

**_Skill_**: a maximum of performance with a minimum of effort

There are three phases in learning a skill like touch-typing:

1. **_Cognitive phase_**: typical of a beginner. Being consciously aware of what he is doing. The process is effortful.
2. **_Associative phase_**: Performance is faster with fewer errors than in the cognitive phase, and movements are smoother. At this stage, the person still has to concentrate on the task. If he is distracted by some other task, performance will decline significantly.
3. **_Autonomous phase_**: The task now seems automatic. If asked, the person may not be able to describe how he is doing what he does-it's just something he does.

> I wish it weren't so, but apparently the only way to reach really outstanding performance in these activities is to invest your time.

* Archieving excellence depends upon getting rapid, high-quality **feedback** 
* Experts in all fields have an explicit concern for *technique*.
* Practice produces if a person continually pushes herself to more and more challenging tasks.

Also, it is clear that some people need less practice than others to reach a particular level of skill.

**Early experiences** seems to be especially helpful to achieve expert status.

**_Subliminal perception_**: when a participant shows evidence of having perceived a stimulus without being consciously aware of it

**_Superliminal_**: above threshold

**_Flow_** ("in the groove", "in the zone", "hack mode"): the experience of being wholly involved in some ativity, just for its own sake, and time flies by and you seem to know what to do without conscious effort

### Attention is the spotlight of the mind

**Attention**: a concentration of the mind on a particular object or process while ignoring others

**_Attentional spotlight_**: an ability to direct our attention to one part of our visual field

**_Cocktail party effect_**: when a persson selectively attends ro a particular conversation out of many conversations taking place

There is a **limited amount** of attention. We don't have as much attention available to us as we think we do.

**_Inattentional blindness_**: when we appear to be "blind" to things that we are not attending to

### Even a brief break in our attention can make us \"blind\"

**_Change blindness_** refers to the failure of people to detect a change in a visual scene.

**_Attentional blink_**: a brief lapse of attention that occurs shortly after we've detected a target 
It's as if their attention is turned off for 200 to 500 ms after detecting the first target-that's the attention blink.

We have absolutely **no conscious awareness** that we have "gone blank" for nearly half a second.

## 10.3 Decision Making and Problem Solving
<!--Page 434-->

**_Decision making_**: the cognitive process of assessing information to select a course of action among several alternatives

One aspect of decision making is **_judgement_**, the cognitive process of forming an opinion or making an evaluation by comparing possible actions.

### Every judgement is subjected to error and bias

Our judgement can be biased by information that we know has absolutely no relevance to the task.

Our tendency when making decisions to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information-even random information-is known as the **_anchoring effect_**.

The anchoring effect is especially powerful in our judgement in the marketplace. It doesn't just affect how valuable we think as item is; it also affects how *many* items we think we need.

### We are all prone to particular errors of judgement

**_Monty Hall problem_**: when someone fails to properly estimate the probability of a particulaar outcome after being given additional information

> You are twice as likely to win if you switch doors. 

### Our hindsight seems so good because our memory is so easily distorted

We may misremember our past judgement to fit our current views. This is **_hindsight bias_**, the tendency to misremember our previous views to fit our current knowledge or beliefs.

**_Confirmation bias_**: the tendency for people to detect and remember information that confirms their preconceptions

**_Belief persistence_**: the tendency to hold on to a belief, even in the face of contradictory evidence

### we hate loss more than we love gain

**_Framing effect_**: when the way information is presented makes a significant difference in what people will decide

Humans tend to be **_loss averse_**: we don't like to risk losing, whether it's losing money or losing other people's lives. 

**_Gambler's fallacy_**: the belief that the outcome of random events up to a given point will affect the probability of future random events

The framing effect can affect our memory as well as our judgement.

### Problem solving involves algorithms, heuristics, and representations

**_Tower of Hanoi_**: a problem in which you transfer a series of different-sized disks from one spindle to another

* Initial state
* Goal state
* Constraints

In many situations we don't know enough to be sure that an **algorithm** will actually accomplish a task. In such cases we may rely on **_heuristic_**, a relatively easy-to-follow set of rules that often, but not always, solves the problem.

### Strategies may help or improve problem solving

**_Availability heuristic_**: We judge the frequency or likelihood of an event based on how readily an example can be brought to mind

Our use of the availability heuristic, fed by media with a financial incentive to get our attention, may cause us to overestimate crime rates. Likewise, gruesome photographs of airplane crashes may be on the minds of people buying life insurance before stepping on a plane.

**_Working backward_**: the problem-solving strategy that starts with the desired end result and reverses the steps needed to get there

Sometimes the weasiest way to solve a problem is to find a good way to **represent** it.

Perhaps in terms of problem-solving in everyday life, this is the most important advice we can follow: try to find as many different ways as possible to look at the problem, because there may be a perspectivefrom which the solution is obvious. Talk to people you trust and get their perspective.

**_Choice blindness_**: where people make a choice between two stimuli and then don't seem to notice when researchers assert that they had actually chosen the other stimulus
