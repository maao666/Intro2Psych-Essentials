# Chapter 4 Genes, Environment, and Behavior

<!-- Both genes and the environment influence schizophrenia and all human behaviors. -->

* Both learning experience and social interactions affect how we use the genes we inherited.

* Genes influence every human behavior, but that no gene determines behavior. 

## 4.1 Genes at Work
<!--Page 111-->

**_Traits_**: A physical or behavioral characteristic feature displayed by an individual.

### The genes we inherit provide "recipes" for making proteins

**_Genes_**: a specific length of DNA that carries the information needed to make one or more of the proteins required for the body to function properly.

> Packed as a set of chromosomes inside every cell's nucleus, tens of thousands of genes allow you to make the many proteins needed to live and grow.

There are four different **_nucleotides_**. **A**denine, **T**hymine, **C**ytosine, and **G**uanine.

There are 20 different **_amino acids_**.
> Cells make different proteins by varying the amino acids and the order in which they are strung together.
> 
> If the amino acids are strung together in the wrong order, the protein may have the wrong shape and may not work the way it should.

**_Alleles_**: genes with **slightly different** instructions for making the **same** protein

**_Mutation_**: a change in DNA sequence resulting in the changes in the instruction for making a protein

> We all carry some mutations

### If we get a nonfunctional allele from one parent, the other allele usually spares us from harm.

**_Natural Selection_**: Mutations that improve survival and reproduction accumulate in subsequent generations, changing a species over time.

**_Genotype_** describes the genetic information you received from your parents. It was set at the instant of **_fertilization_** and never changes.

**_Phenotype_**: the sum of an individual's physical characteristics at one particular time, including hair color, intelligence. It changes every day.

### We can see how dominant and recessive alleles work in pea plants

## 4.2 The Regulation of Genes
<!--Page 118-->

### Different genes are used at different times in different cells

**_Gene expression_**: the process of a cell using a gene to make a particular protein.

> Cells carefully control which proteins they produce, and how much to produce, by closely regulating how genes are expressed.

> Much of the long stretches of DNA between genes determines whether the neighboring genes will be expressed. 

### Sensory experience and learning affect gene expression

> The fact that gene expression in the brain changes constantly in response to experience explains why both **_nature_** and **_nurture_** influence human behavior.
> 
> Both genes and experience are important because experience affects gene expression.

### Genes and experience interact

**_Epigenetics_** is the study of factors that *affect gene expression*. 

> **Epigenetic effects** occur when environmental conditions influence gene expression.

**_Gene-environment interaction_**: the effect of the environment on gene expression.

> Environmental influences such as enriching experiences and maternal care significantly modify the effects of genes on behavior and accomplishment.

## 4.3 Single Gene Effects on Behavior
<!--Page 124-->

Many genes each have a small effect. There are exceptions though.

1. Destructive processes
2. ssensoty defects

### Genes that severely disrupt brain function have a strong, direct, and disastrous effect on behavior

> In many cases, fetuses with alleles producing harmful proteins do not survive.

**_Huntington's disease_** is caused by a dominant harmful allele which poisons certain neurons in the brain. 

> It's not common because the carrier usually does not survive to reproduce and pass the allele.

**_Phenylketonuria (PKU)_** is a *recessive* (two non-functioning alleles) hereditary disorder resulting in mental impairment. 
> The first time that a genetic problem was associated with mental disability. The right environment can prevent such mental impairment.

### Genes that affect sensory systems can have a strong effect on behavior

One protein is responsible for distinguishing green light from red light.
Such **color-blind** is more common in males than in females.

Most cases of **inherited deafness** are the result of *recessive* genes.

## 4.4 Multiple Genes Effects on Behavior
<!--Page 130-->

### Twin studies confirm a genetic contribution to schizophrenia

**_Schizophrenia_**: a mental disorder characterized by **hallucinations** (usually hearing voices), **delusions** (belief in untrue things), disordered thinking, and emotional withdrawal.

> About 1% of the human population will exhibit the condition at *some point in life*.

The more genes someone shares with a person with schizophrenia, the more likely he or she is to develop the disorder. 

**_Confounding variables_** in this case: People who share similar genes also tend to share similar environments. 

**_Twin studies_** can **tease out the confounding variable** of similar environments shared by relatives.

**_Monozygotic twins_** (identical twins): the result of a single zygote. They tend to be more similar to each other, including behavior.

**_Dizygotic twins_** (non-identical twins): result from two different zygotes

Twins are **_concordant_** for a trait if *both* individuals have that trait. (Both have or both do not have)

Twins are **_discordant_** for a trait if one has it and the other does not.

Monozygotic twins are more likely to be concordant than dizygotic twins are.

### What does it mean if a behavior is \"heritable\"?

A trait is **_heritable_** if it is influenced by one or more genes inherited from the parents.

**_Heritability_**: a statistic estimate of **the extent to which individual differences in genes** in a population contribute to individual difference **in a trait**. 

> **Heritability**: What percentage of variation for that trait is caused by the various genotypes.

> The environment accounts for the rest of the variation.

>> Example: heritability for schizophrenia is 0.60 *means* that about *60% of all the variability* in schizophrenia in the population is due to *variability in the genes* in that population.

### What heritability does not mean

The differences in people's genes play **at least a small role in every case** but that difference in people's genes alone **cannot explain all the cases**.

Although heritability estimates offer **no predictive power** about **a particular individual**, they make it clear that **genes do matter**.

### Inferences about heritability from twin studies make several simplifying assumptions

Estimates of heritability based on comparing monozygotic and dizygotic twins are going to **overestimate** the influence of genes.

### Cases of identical twins who are reared apart offer powerful insights

**Adoption studies**: raising twins apart

**Genes are responsible** for **the greater concordance** for schizophrenia in identical versus non-identical twins.

## 4.5 The Interaction of Genes and Experience
<!--Page 135-->

Exposure to **stress** can increase the likelihood of schizophrenia.

### Stress plays a role in the appearance of schizophrenia

The proportion of people with schizophrenia is **greater in cities** the rural areas, probably because city life is **more stressful** than rural life.

> Most people who develop the disorder start displaying symptoms at the age when they must make the stressful transition **from adolescence to adulthood**.

### Genes and the environment constantly interact to affect our behaviors

In rats, maternal neglect can epigenetically imprint certain genes in the pups to cause them to be more anxious in adulthood, and there is evidence that this same gene is affected by early neglect in humans.
