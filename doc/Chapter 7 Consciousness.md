# Chapter 7 Consciousness

### 7.1 Consciousness
<!--Page 248-->

**_Consciousness_**: our **perception** of what's going on *in our minds*

We do *not* perceive some processes going on in our mind, and by definition they are **unconscious**.

### It's difficult to access consciousness

The hallmark of consciousness is that it is **personal** and **subjective**. 

It is this fleeting, roaming nature of consciousness that moved psychology pioneer William James to talk of the "stream of consciousness".

**Brain imaging** and **computer modeling** gave researchers a window into the participant's mind.

The **_easy problem of consciousness_** (**mind-body problem**): finding out what particular pattern of brain activity underlies a relatively simple conscious experience, such as seeing a rabit.

**_Qualia_**: the entire subjective experience a person has with each perception. 

> We give the color the same name,  but that color has a different *qualia* for you and me. 

The **_hard problem of consciousness_**: how do we know what brain processes result in our personal couscious experience

> We have no way of unambiguously communicating the qualia we are experiencing because, as we've seen, the fact that we use the same *word* for it is no guarentee that we have the same *experience*. There's just no way for me to slip inside your mind and see exactly what "red" looks like for you. Some neuroscientists think that we will never be able to solve the hard problem. 

### The brain's activity is similar whether we imagine something or actually see it

The parts of the brain that are active when we *imagine* seeing something are the same parts that are activated by actually seeing that thing.

### What is the function of consciousness

Consciousness offers a powerful tool for telling the future. 

Running simulations of what would happen allows us to anticipate different consequences so that we can choose what to do. 

**_Internal dialogue_**: the words and sentences passing through our mind as a form of self-talk or inner speech, allowing us to mentally rehersal that we'll say next

### Split-brain patients offer clues about consciousness without language

**_Split brain_**: the result of a surgery that destroys the pathways of communication between the two cerebral hemispheres. 

**_Corpus callosum_**: the main band of axons communicating between the two cerebral hemispheres

The two minds are probably in synchrony most of the time. Simply moving the head and eyes, bringing the scene into both visual fields.

Each hemisphere in the split-brain patient can also keep track of what the other hemisphere is doing.

### In split-brain patients, the verbal mind tries to explain what the other mind is doing

It appears that the left brain is constantly trying to explain what the body just did. Sometimes the left, talking hemisphere engages in confabulation.

**_Confabulation_**: filling in a gap in memory or understanding with a fabrication that the person believes to be true

While we know what we want to do next, we are unaware of why we want to do that.

### We are not always aware of what our brain has decided to do

**_Free will_**: the power to make choices that are not constrained by supernatural, nonphysical forces such as fate, spirits, or gods.

> Scientists monitoring brain recordings can predict when the participant is going to perform an act *several seconds before he or she is aware of any such decisions*. These experiments call into question **whether our conscious self is actually involved in our decisions** or **simply becomes aware of decisions other parts of our brain made**. These experiments *neither* prove *nor* disprove whether we have free will.
