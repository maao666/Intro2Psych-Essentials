## 8.1 Predicting the Future
<!--Page 308-->

### The simplest learning tasks involve only cue

**_Habituation_**: a simple type of learning in which repeated presentation of a stimulus elicits a weaker and weaker response. (to learn to ignore unimportant events)

* Two conditions must be met:
	* The subject must be *able* to *respond* - a reduced response caused by muscle exhaustion is *not* habituation
	* The subject's sensory system must still be *able* to *detect* the stimulus - sensory adaptation is *not* considered learning.

#### Reversing habituation

The sudden return of a response that had formerly been habituated is called **_dishabituation_**.

**_Sensitization_**: a very strong stimulus, typically an obnoxious, unpleasant one, causes an *enhanced* response to a variety of other stimuli.


**_Non-associative learning_**: There's no particular predictive relationship between any two stimuli.

* Habituation
* Dishabituation
* Sensitization

**_Associative learning_**: A relationship is formed between tewo stimuli or between a stimulus and a behavior.

* Classical conditioning 
* Operant conditioning

### Classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning) teaches us to anticipate the future

Pavlov's experiment

**Classical conditioning_**: a basic form of learning in which a neutral stimulus (like the bell) is repeatedly followed by another stimulus (like the meat powder), which normally elicits a response (salivation), until the formerly neutral stimulus (bell) now elicits that response.

**_Unconditioned stimulus (US)_**: a stimulus that **naturally** evokes a special response - **_Unconditioned response (UR)_**. 

**_Conditioned stimulus (CS)_**: the previously neural stimulus that, after repeated pairing with the US, eventually triggers the response - **_conditioned response (CR)_**.

**_Acquisition_**: in the context of classical conditioning, the gradual appearance of the CR in response to the CS alone. 

Rats are built to learn to associate a neutral stimulus with the US *if and only if* that neutral stimulus does help them predict the future. 

### Subjects in classical conditioning learn about more than just the conditioned stimulus

The dogs had learned that white lab coats predicted the coming of food.

**_Second-order conditioning_** (secondary conditioning):  when a previously learned CS, which elicits a CR, repeatedly follows another neutral stimulus so that the second neutral stimulus also comes to elicit a CR.

**_Stimulus generalization_**: when the subject displays a CR to stimuli that are similar to, but not exactly identical to, the CS used in training.

### Our everyday hebavior reflects what we've learned by classical conditioning

**_Extinction_**: when repeated presentation of the CS (sound) without US(food) results in a weaker and weaker CR

**_Spontaneous recovery_**: when the previously extinguished CR in response to the CS returns after a period of rest

### Taste aversion proved the relevance of evolution to conditioning

Natural selection has flavored the tendency to readily associate nausea with something we previously ate or drank. This may help us avoid ingesting poisons or tocxins that make us ill.

**_Conditioned taste aversion_** (taste aversion or Garcia effect): the acquired repulsion to a taste or flavor that was previously followed by nausea.

Some behaviors are more easily learned by one species than another is described as **_biological constraints on learning_**.

### Fear conditioning is a type of classical conditioning using a painful unconditioned stimulus

**_Fear conditioning_**: paring a previouslu neutral stimulus with a painful stumulus
**_Phobia_**: an irretional fear of particular objects or situations.

The fear can be unlearned by presenting the CS without the US until the animal unlearns the association.

## 8.2 Reinforcing Behavior
<!--Page 322-->

### Live and learn: Thornadike's law

The **_law of effect_**: any behavior that results in a satisfactory outcome is more likely to recur in the future. (Connectionism) (also applies for unpleasant outcome)

**_Behaviorism_**: only study externally visible behavior. Called by John B. Watson

### Everyone likes to be rewarded

**_Operant conditioning_** (Instrumental learning): the subject's behavior *operated* on the environment, controlling what would happen next.

**_Operant conditioning chambers_** **(Skinner boxes)**: cages in which animals can learn to do a simple task, such as press a bar, to get a reward

**_Reinforcer_**: a stimulus that increases the probability of the behavior recurring

**_shaping_**: the process by which a subject is easily provided with a reinforcer whenever the subject comes close to showing the desired behavior, and then is required to come closer and closer to that desired behavior before receiving the reinforcer.

By rewarding the participants in stages, encouraging the beginning of the desired behavior and requiring participants to come closer and closer to find the product, it's possible not only to speed up learning, but also teach highly complex behaviors.

**_Supersitition_**: the false belief that a particular behavior will bring about a stimulus or event.

### Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative

|Stimulus type | Increase the behavior | Decrease the Behavior|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**Pleasant**| Positive reinforcement | Negative punishment|
|**Unpleasant**(aversive)| Negative reinforcement | Positive punishment|

### Punishment can be counterproductive 

First, it needs to be swift, coming soon after offense. 

It is important to explain to the child what behavior triggered the punishment and why it was inappropriate. 

Finally, punishments must be used consistently to be effective.

### Active avoidance is especially resistant to extinction

**_Escape conditioning_**: An animal is subjected to an unpleasant stimulus and must learn to do something to stop that aversive stimulus.

**_Active avoidance_**: when a subject must display a particular behavior to avoid an unpleasant stimulus

**_Passive avoidance_**: subjects must refrain from showing a particular behavior to avoid unpleasant stimulus.

**_Learned helplessness_**: when a subject learns that there's *no* response that can prevent an aversive stimulus

Learned helplessness has been suggested as a model of humans who are clinically depressed, which is not so much typified by sadness as by a disinterest in being active and a lack of belief that taking action will improve things.

Some people seem more susceptible than others to depression, and that heredity accounts at least some of that variation.

### The pace of rewards affects how quickly and well we learn

**_Reinforcement schedule_**: the rules determining the frequency with which and an operant conditioning subject is reinforced

Not only do animals tend to press the bar more times and at a faster rate, but the **_variable ratio (VR)_** schedule gets this increased performance with fewer reinforcements then a **_fixed ratio (FR)_** schedule.

A rat on them **_fixed interval (FI)_** schedule will not press a far as rapidly as read on and fixed ratio (FR) or variable ratio (VR) schedule which makes sense because more rapid presses do not bring the food faster.

Animals trained on the **_variable interval (VI)_** schedule do not typically press the bar as often as animals on an FR or VR schedule, but they show steady consistent performance.

<!--Page 335-->

The **_primary reinforcer_** is typically something that fills a biological need (like food, water, or sex), or in the case of punishments, something the subject already finds unpleasant that can be used to increase or decrease particular behaviors.

**_Secondary reinforcer_**: something the subject comes to associate with one or more primary reinforcers, and which can therefore be used to increase or decrease particular behaviors.

## 8.3 Observational Learning

By the mid-20s century many investigators suggested that even rats are learning more about the world than simply which stimulus tend to precede another (as in classical conditioning), or which behavior leads to rewards or punishments (as in operant conditioning).

### Does a rat in a maze become lost in thought?

**_Cognitive map_**: an internal representation of the layout of an area

Many neuroscience experiments have established that neurons in one part of a rats brain, the hippocampus and nearby cortex, fire only when the rat is in the particular part of a maze, regardless of whether there's any food reward.

One part of the brain seems to keep careful track of where we are in space, which is certainly consistent with a function as a cognitive map. 

Animals can learn about amaze even in the absence of any apparent reinforcement.

**_Latent learning_**: when a subject has in fact learned something without showing it right away

### \"You can observe a lot by watching\"

**_Observational learning_** refers to things one individual learns by observing another individual.

### Social learning profoundly shapes human behavior

**_Social learning_**: changes in behavior brought about by interacting with other individuals

#### The Bobo Doll studies

A person immolates Moto's behavior will for criteria are met:

1. The person must be **paying attention** to the model's behavior.
2. The person must **retain** the information gained about the observed behavior.
3. The person most **reproduce** the behavior, and may get progressively better at imitating the behavior with practice.
4. The person must be motivated to reproduce the model behavior.

**_Social monitoring_**, or social referencing, seen refers to when an individual observes the consequences of someone else's behavior to guide their own behavior.

### Sometimes insight plays a role in learning

**_Insight_**: a sudden understanding of a problem that leads to a solution without having to resort to trial or error
