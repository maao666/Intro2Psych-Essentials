# Chapter 9 Memory

## 9.1 The Stages of Memory Formartion

Three stages:

1. Sensory memory
2. Short-term memory (STM)
3. Long-term memory

### We retain raw sensory information for only a few seconds

The sensory information is kept for only a short while, in what is called the **_sensory buffer_** (or sensory memory).

**_Photographic memory_** (eidetic memory): the ability to recall entire images with extreme detail.

### Short-term memory is brief, but can be extended if we work with the information

Once information has entered STM, we can hold on to it by **_rehersal_**, the conscious repetition of information.

**_Working memory_**: a system that keeps memories available for ready access during performance of a task. (We hold information while we are working with it to solve a problem, or are otherwise actively manipulating the information.)

### Long-term memories also fade unless they are used

**_Nonsense syllables_**: short combinations of letters intended to be meaningless like CAJ, WID

The exsponential loss of memory

### Short-term memory and long-term memory rely on different processes

**_Primacy effect_**: the improved recall of items from the **beginning of the list** in a recall task

**_Recency effect_**: the improved recall of items at the **end of the list** in a recall task

The **recency effect** is **due to STM** and the **primacy effect to LTM**. The primacy effect lasts longer and is attributed to LTM. 

* Three processes of **information transfer**:
	* **_Encoding_**: the transfer of information **from sensory system to STM**
	* **_Consolidation_**: the transfer of information **from STM to LTM**
	* **_Memory retrieval_**: the transfer of information **out of LTM for use in STM**

### We have to encode information in order to store and retieve it

**_Chunking_**: an encoding strategy that breaks down a long list of items into several "chunks" to ease memorization

**_Hierarchies_**: organizational structures where items have some relationship to one another

### Some short-term memories are consolidated into the vast store of long-term memory

We will never really know the maximum capacity of LTM. 

Natural selection favors the tendency to forget unimportant information.

## 9.2 The Vulnerability of Memory
<!--Page 366-->

There are basically two processes to explain why we forget, and probably both are at work: memories are either **gone** or **misplaced** (still present).

**_Fade_**: the gradual disappearance of a memory based on its physical loss from the brain

**_Forgetting_**: the inability to retrieve information from LTM, either because the information is gone entirely or because the participant cannot retrieve the information that is still there.

Forgetting is a normal, useful aspect of memory, helping filter out unimportant information, perhaps in order to free up needed cognitive resources.

Sometimes people say they "forgot" something when *they never really got the information from STM to LTM in the first place*.

### Sometimes one memory can interfere with another

**_Proactive interference_**: when an existing memory interferes with formation of a new memory. The "pro" refers to the fact that the first memory is acting *forward* in time, interfering with the future, specifically the attempt to form a new memory.

The more similar two stimuli are, the more the memories of those stimuli can interfere with one another.

**_Retroactive_ interference**: when forming a new memory makes it harder to retrieve an old memory. The "retro" refers to the idea that this new memory is working *backward* in time, interfering with a previous memory.

The participants who were sleeping were experiencing less retroactive interference than the participants who stayed awake. 

> This suggests that, rather than staying up all night cramming information before a test, you might be better off learning some core of the material and then going to sleep so you can cosolidate that information without interference.

Whether the memory ever disappears entirely or nor, the more it fades, the less likely it will interfere with our attempts to retrieve other memories. 

### Several psychological phenomena indicate that forgetting is probably due to a failure in retrieval

**_Cued recall_**: improved recollection resulting from a cue, hint, or guide to the answer 

**_Free call_**: a person must retrieve the information without any hints or guides

**_Priming_**: exposure to a stimulus that influences response to a later stimuli

**_Spreading activation_**: the idea that words and objects that are related to one another are somehow connected in our memory, so that recalling one word is likely to lead us to recall another related word.

Most memories are connected to more than one additional memory.

**_semantic webs_**: large networks of words with meanings that have different degrees of connection to one another

We can never be sure that any memory is completely gone. Logically, all we can say is that the participant could not recall the information under conditions in which we tested. 

**_Context-dependent retrieval_** is the ability to retrieve additional information when the conditions in which the original learning took place are duplicated

### Memory is susceptible to distortion

**_Memory trace_**: the physical record of a memory made in the brain by a learning experience, doesn't simply deteriorate from disuse and the passage of time. 

Memory tend to suffer interference from events before or after they were formed.

Memory distortion offers one explain of why people sometimes honestly remember events that never happened.

**_Misinformation_**: the susceptibility of our memory to incorporate false details that fit in

> For the participants, recollecting that early event somehow made it open to distortion, so now they remembered something that never happened.

Controversial therapeutic methods such as hypnosis or guided imagery can inadvertently plant false memories.

**_Flashbulb memory_**: esperially vivid, detailed memories of an especially emotional or momentous occasion

The **unreliability of flashbulb memories** serves as an important reminder that our memories can be faulty *even when we feel strongly that they are accurate*.

\"The *Seven Sins of Memory*\" 

### How can you improve your memory

> When memorizing a list, making sure the information is accurate and overlearning it helps cement the imformation in LTM.

**_Mnemonic devices_**: methods of helping to memorize information

> "Roy G. Biv.": the order of the colors in a rainbow

**_Method of loci_**: a mnemonic device where each item of a list is imagined in a seperate location in a familiar place

**_Tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon_**: when we fell that we can almost say aloud the word we are trying to remember

> say random names aloud

## 9.3 Different Forms of Long-Term Memory
<!--Page 378-->

### There are different types of amnesia (Greek for \"forgetfulness\")

* **_Retrograde amnesia_**: loss of **old memory** formed prior to a trauma

* **_Anterograde amnesia_**: the inability to form **new memories** after an event

Patient H.M. could not form new explicit memories. In Henry's case, the inability to transfer memories from STM to LTM lasted the rest of his life.

### The hippocampus is required to put some memories into LTM elsewhere in the brain

Henry's surgeon removed quite a bit of both temporal lobes of the cortex, including several structures beneath the surface.

Henry's amnesia was due to the loss of the **medial temporal lobe**, which includes the **hippocampus** and neighboring cortical regions.

* **_Declarative memory_** (**explicit memory**): facts and information acquired through learning that we can "declare" to others
* **_Nondeclarative memory_** (**implicit memory**): memory about perceptual or motor procedures that is demonstrated by performance

### People with Korsakoff's syndrome, like H.M., have trouble forming new declarative memories

**_Korsakoff's syndrome_**: displaying both retrograde amnesia, typically extending back several years, and anterograde amnesia such as Henry's. 

Unlike Henry, people with Korsakoff's syndrome frequently deny that anything is wrong with them.

**_Confabulate_**: filling a gap in memory with a falsification that they seem to accept as true

Korsakoff's patients have shrunken, diseased **_mammillary bidies_** (a pair of structures in the brainstem) and damage to sites in the brainstem.

The mammillary bodies may serve as a narrow funnel through which connections from the hippocampus gain access to the cortex.

### Brain damage can destroy autobiographical memories while sparing general memories

There are two different subtypes of declarative memory.

**_Patient K.C._**: a patient who, because of damage to his cortex, lost all memory for personal information but retained his memory for general knowledge.

**_Episodic memory_**: You show episodic memory when you recall a special episode in your life or relate an event to a particular time and space.

**_Semantic memory_**: generalized declarative memory such as knowing the meaning of a word without knowing where or when you learned that word

You can think of semantic memory as a huge store of knowledge that we all carry with us.

Episodic and semantic memories rely on distinctive brain processes.

It is rare for retrograde amnesia to extend back to more than a few days before the traumatic event.

### Different forms of nondeclarative memory serves varying functions

**_Skill learning_**: learning to perform a challenging task

**_Conditioning_**: learning simple associations between stimuli

### What is the physical basis of memory

**_Engram_**: the physical encoding of a memory in the brain

A learning experience **physically alters the brain**, which is one of our four principles of psychology. For many people, this idea that experience could physically alter the brain that the brain is *plastic*, able to change its shape, was difficult to accept.

Periods of intense learning are sometimes accompanied by the formation of new neurons in the brain, even in adult humans.

### Long-term potentiation (LTP) may provide a physical basis for memory

**_Hebbian synapse_**: a synapse that becomes stronger if it often causes the postsynaptic neuron to fire, and gets weaker if it rearly causes the postsynaptic cell to fire

The stable and long lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission was named **_long term potentiation (LTP)_**.
"Potentiation" means a strengthening. 

**_Non-matching-to-sample test_**: The subject demonstrates recognition of an object by **not touching it**; used to **demonstrate declarative memory**.

It looks like other mammals also depend on the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, to transfer information from STM to LTM.

> Henry died in 2008, at the age of 82. With his death to the world at large learned for the first time that patient H.M., who had taught us so much about a memory was, named Henry Molaison, as revealed in his obituary in _The New York Times_, which called him "an unforgettable amnesiac." 
> Before his death Henry and his court-appointed guardian agreed that when he died his brain could be examined by scientists. 
> In 2009, webcasting technology made it possible for thousands of people to watch live as Henry's brain was carefully sectioned into thousands of slices to determine exactly what was damaged by that surgery 55 years before. Photomicrographics of every section are available to all researchers.

> To the end, although he could remember so little of his entire adult life, Henry was courteous and concerned about other people. He remembered the surgeon he had met several times before his operation: "He did medical research on people... What he learned about me helping others too, and I am glad about that".
> Henry never knew how famous he was, or how much his dreadful condition taught us about learning and memory while simultaneously robbing him of a normal human life. 
> Yet despite being deprived of one of the most important characteristics of a human being, he held fast to his humanity.
